Cayenne pepper, hot sauce and melted butter or margarine are the basis of the 
sauce, which may be mild, medium, or hot. Typically, the wings are deep-fried 
in oil (although they are sometimes grilled or baked) until they are well 
browned. They are then drained, mixed with sauce, and shaken to coat the 
wings, completely covering them in the sauce.
